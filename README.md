üéôÔ∏è AI Voice Assistant
An advanced, customizable AI Voice Assistant built with Python and web technologies to enable seamless voice-driven interactions with digital systems.

üöÄ Overview
This project is a Final Year Project (FYP) designed to revolutionize how users interact with devices by providing a hands-free, intelligent voice assistant. It combines Python for backend logic and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, delivering a rich, conversational, and interactive experience. The assistant supports a variety of functionalities including speech recognition, text-to-speech, YouTube/app/web automation, WhatsApp messaging, and more.

üí° Features
üîä Core Functionalities
Speech Recognition: Converts voice commands into actionable text using the SpeechRecognition library.

Text-to-Speech (TTS): Uses pyttsx3 to give audio responses with natural voice feedback.

Hotword Detection: Wake the assistant with custom keywords like ‚ÄúHello Xyrix‚Äù.

üß† Advanced Capabilities
YouTube & App Control: Open specific videos, apps, or websites using voice.

WhatsApp Automation: Send messages via voice using API integration.

Chatting: Respond to general queries using conversational NLP.

Drawing Canvas & Emotion Recognition: Add creativity and emotional intelligence to your assistant.

üß∞ Technical Implementation
Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):
‚Ä¢	User Interface: Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
‚Ä¢	Speech Recognition: Utilize the Web Speech API to capture user voice input.
‚Ä¢	Backend Communication: Implement a mechanism to send voice commands to the backend and receive processed responses.
Backend (Python):
‚Ä¢	Speech-to-Text: Employ libraries like Speech Recognition to convert voice input into text.
‚Ä¢	Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilize NLP techniques to understand and interpret user intent.
‚Ä¢	Task Execution: Develop Python scripts to execute specific tasks based on user commands.
‚Ä¢	Text-to-Speech: Employ libraries like pyttx3 to convert text into speech.
‚Ä¢	API Integration: Integrate with APIs for services like YouTube, Whatsapp,Google.
‚Ä¢	Machine Learning: Implement machine learning models for facial recognition and hot word detection.

üìå Future Enhancements
‚Ä¢	Cross-platform compatibility: Extend support to Linux and macOS.
‚Ä¢	Multilingual support: Add recognition and response in Urdu, Arabic, and other languages.
‚Ä¢	Voice personalization: Let users select or upload custom voice packs.
‚Ä¢	AI learning: Implement adaptive learning to better understand individual user patterns.
‚Ä¢	Cloud sync: Backup preferences, logs, and conversation history.
‚Ä¢	Mobile App Version: Port Xyrix to Android and iOS for voice control on the go.
